Project: Genetic Algorithms to SolveTravel Salesperson Problem

Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to
optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as
mutation, crossover and selection. In this project, our team is focused on using
it to solve Travel Salesperson Problem.

The Travel Salesperson Problem is an NP-hard problem. TSP problems can
be divided into two categories, one is Symmetric TSP and the other is
Asymmetric TSP. All TSP issues can be described by a graph:

V={c1,c2,...,ci,...,cn},i=1,2,...,n is a collection of all cities. ci represents the ith
city, n is the number of cities;

E={(r,s):r,s∈V} is a collection of connections between all cities;

C={crs:r,s∈V} is a measure of the cost of connections between all cities
(generally the distance between cities);

If crs=csr, then the TSP problem is symmetric, otherwise it is asymmetric.

A TSP problem can be expressed as: Solving the traversal graph G = (V, E, C),
all nodes once and back to the starting node, so that the path cost of connecting
these nodes is the lowest.
